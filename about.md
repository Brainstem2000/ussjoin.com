Looking for a prose description of me? Here you'll find the bio I use for security conferences, and the bio I use for legal conferences.

<h2>Security Conferences</h2>

Described by coworkers as "not the lawyer we need, but the lawyer we deserve," Brendan O'Connor is a security researcher and Senior Security Advisor at Leviathan Security Group in Seattle, WA. He is admitted to the Montana bar, and serves as Vice-Chair of the ABA's Information Security Committee; while he is a lawyer, he is not your lawyer. He was awarded two DARPA Cyber Fast Track contracts for his security research, which focuses primarily on enabling access to security and privacy through development of disposable computing and sensing tools. He has taught at an information warfare school, played the violin, transmitted on amateur radio (K3QB), and tried to convince his cat not to eat him when he dies.

<h2>Legal Conferences</h2>

Brendan O'Connor is a Senior Security Advisor at Leviathan Security Group in Seattle, WA. Brendan has a combination of legal and practical digital security experience. He holds the degrees of Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Engineering, both in Computer Science, from The Johns Hopkins University, where his research focused on the privacy and security implications of distributed identities. After leaving Hopkins, he worked for a DARPA contractor developing novel security-related technology before founding his own business, Malice Afterthought. He spent time teaching at a military information warfare school before becoming a full-time student at the University of Wisconsin Law School; while there, he consulted on security R&D issues for both public- and private-sector clients, and won two DARPA Cyber Fast Track contracts to pursue research related to the privacy implications of disposable computing before graduating cum laude in 2014 with an honors concentration in international law and a concentration in criminal law. He is admitted to the bar in the state of Montana. He has presented at several well-known computer security conferences both in the United States and abroad, including Black Hat USA and Europe, DEF CON, Paranoia, and ShmooCon. His research has been featured by Forbes, the New York Times, and Bloomberg TV, among others.
